# Project Detail
Implemented a parser for Python language by using Context-free Grammar (CFG) with ANTLR. ANTLR generates a parser that builds and walk parse trees from grammer. This is not a complete parser and will only include basic features. Expected Features: if/else blocks, variable definitions, while and for loops, Arithmetic operators, assignment operators, and conditional statements.
