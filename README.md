# Team Command Line Parser Project


### Project Explanation

We created a Python interpreter using Java and ANTLR. From ANTLR's website, "ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees."

### Prerequisites to run

1. ANTLR - Our team used ANTLR as it was reccommended in the project description and we found it to be the best of the other options when it came to documentation.
2. IntelliJ - IntelliJ is the IDE we chose to run this.



### Neccessary steps for setting up (Feel free to skip a step if anything is already installed)
1. Download [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
2. Download this repository (Just as a zip and go ahead and open/unzip the contents)
3. Download the ANTLR jar: https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.9-complete.jar (Press to download)
4. We need to install the [Java SE Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html). This will be used as our JDK.


### Getting the code ready to run (Assuming no experience with IntelliJ)
1. Open IntelliJ and create a new project. You will need to select Java (which will be on the left side). For the 'Project JDK' this is where we will want to make sure we use the JDK 1.8 that we grabbed from step 3 on the last section. The project can be named whatever and placed wherever, and then finish by creating it. 
2. Next we need to add the ANTLR plugin. Press the "IntelliJ IDEA" at the top left and go down to preferences and select it, and then plugins on the new pop up window.
4. Search "ANTLR v4 Plugin" and install it. Once installed we can close out of the pop up.
5. Now we need to drag the unzipped repo (use your finder) into the location of where this project was made.
